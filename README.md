# Duality & entanglement: double-path experiment on IBM Q
This software allows one to compute concurrence, distinguishability and visibility of interference fringes, in the framework of a double-path interference experiment using a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, coded on the IBM Q quantum computer.

# Introduction
The double-slit experiment can be performed on a quantum computer. This implementation is a modified version of the double-path experiment, which allows to measure concurrence, distinguishability and visibility. This uses 2 qubits, and the quantities are special cases of concurrence of the pair, predictability and coherence of the first qubit.
